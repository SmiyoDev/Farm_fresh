Farm Fresh is a web application that connects consumers directly with farmers to purchase fresh products. The project uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend, and Node.js with Express and MySQL for the backend. To run the server, navigate to the backend directory, install dependencies with npm install, and start the server with npm start. The backend server runs on port 5500. The frontend can be served using a live server on port 8080.
